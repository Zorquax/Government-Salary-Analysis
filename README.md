# Governemnt Salary Prediction

This project aims to predict government salaries based on various attributes given.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from the official Government website:
[Gov Analysis](https://data.nj.gov/Government-Finance/YourMoney-Authority-Payroll/kiki-imre/about_data)

But there is a local copy available in this repository.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating the Virtual Environment

To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv datascience_env
```

Alternatively, use ```python3``` instead of ```python```. 

### 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

```
source ./datascience_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Installing Required Libraries

Install all necessary libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Notebook

Open and execute the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the model.

### 5. Alternatively, run from Visual Studio code, set the python interpreter to datascience_env, then install required kernels to execute.
